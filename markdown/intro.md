## React Declarative Components

Beautiful minimalist components in React rendered with mostly serializable configuration.

Components are from [radix-ui](https://www.radix-ui.com/) with state configuration and API bindings to [react-form-hook](https://react-hook-form.com/get-started) styled with vanilla CSS (for now).
